<Harry, nephew, Mr. Vernon Dursley>
Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
nephew Harry's room.

<Petunia,wife,Uncle Vernon>
"Do I look stupid?" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling
from his bushy mustache. "I know what'll happen if that owl's let
out."

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.


<Dudley,son,Dursleys>
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.


<Snape,Potions master, Harry Potter>
<Hagrid,gamekeeper, Harry Potter>
Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys
were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how
Harry felt.

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant
stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the
mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his
four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,
Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,
especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world
(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).

<Hedwig,owl,Harry>
Uncle Vernon had even padlocked
Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying
messages to anyone in the wizarding world.

<Uncle Vernon, uncle, Harry>
<Aunt Petunia, aunt, Harry>
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was
large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia
was horse-faced and bony

<Mr. Mason, husband, Mrs. Mason>
"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me
where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......

<Hermione Granger, best friend, Harry>
<Ron Weasley, best friend, Harry>
Harry missed his best friends, Ron
Weasley and Hermione Granger

<Draco Malfoy, archenemy, Harry>
For the first
couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words
under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast
as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and
Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that
even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione
had forgotten his birthday.
What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,
Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....

<Albus Dumbledore, greatest headmaster, Harry>
"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever
had.

<Hagrid,gamekeeper,Harry>
Harry could make out Hermione's neat
writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though
it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.

<Fred, elder twin brother, Ron>
<George, elder twin brother, Ron>
Grinning at Harry from the front seats
were Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers.

<Draco Malfoy, son, Lucius Malfoy>
"Draco Malfoy?" said George, turning around. "Not Lucius Malfoy's
son?"


<Lucius Malfoy, big supporter, You-Know-Who>
"Draco Malfoy?" said George, turning around. "Not Lucius Malfoy's
son?"

"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?" said Harry.

Y.

"I've heard Dad talking about him," said George. "He was a big
supporter of You-Know-Who."


<Errol, owl, Ron>
<Hermes, owl, Percy>
"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway," said Ron. "I was getting
really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it
was Errol's fault at first

-"

"Who's Errol?"

"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed
on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -"

"Who?"

"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,"
said Fred from the front.

"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me," said Ron. "Said he needed
him."

<Mrs. Weasley, Mum, George>
Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,
staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered
apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.

"So, "she said.

"Morning, Mum," said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,
winning voice.

"Have you any idea how worried I've been?" said Mrs. Weasley in a
deadly whisper.

<Fred, George, Ron, sons, Mrs. Weasley>
All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they
cowered as her rage broke over them.

<Mrs. Weasly, Mum, Fred>
<Mrs. Weasley, Mum, George>
"It was cloudy, Mum!" said Fred.

"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!" Mrs. Weasley
snapped.

"They were starving him, Mum!" said George.

<Ginny, sister, Ron>
"Ginny," said Ron in an undertone to Harry. "My sister. She's been
talking about you all summer."

<Mr. Weasley, Dad, Fred>
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.

"Find anything, Dad?" said Fred eagerly.

<Scabbers, rat, Ron>
Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish
tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,
Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.

<Percy,elder brother, Ron>
Fortunately no one saw this except Harry,
because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in.
