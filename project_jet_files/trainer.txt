Book 40        Matthew

40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
           the son of Abraham.

40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
           Judas and his brethren;

40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
           Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
           Naasson begat Salmon;

40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
           and Obed begat Jesse;

40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
           Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
           begat Asa;

40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
           begat Ozias;

40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
           begat Ezekias;

40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
           begat Josias;

40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
           they were carried away to Babylon:

40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
           Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
           Eliakim begat Azor;

40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
           Eliud;

40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
           Matthan begat Jacob;

40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
           Jesus, who is called Christ.

40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
           generations; and from David until the carrying away into
           Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
           into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
           mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
           she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
           make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
           privily.

40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
           LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
           David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
           which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
           JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
           spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
           son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
           interpreted is, God with us.

40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
           Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
           and he called his name JESUS.
