40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
           the son of Abraham.

40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
           Judas and his brethren;

40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
           Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
           Naasson begat Salmon;

40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
           and Obed begat Jesse;

40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
           Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
           begat Asa;

40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
           begat Ozias;

40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
           begat Ezekias;

40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
           begat Josias;

40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
           they were carried away to Babylon;

40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
           Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
           Eliakim begat Azor;

40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
           Eliud;

40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
           Matthan begat Jacob;

40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
           Jesus, who is called Christ.

40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
           generations; and from David until the carrying away into
           Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
           into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
           mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
           she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
           make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
           privily.
correc
40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
           LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
           David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
           which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
           JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
           spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
           son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
           interpreted is, God with us.

40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
           Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
           and he called his name JESUS.

42:003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
           Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being
           tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of
           Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
           tetrarch of Abilene,

42:003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
           came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

42:003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
           baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

42:003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
           prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
           Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

42:003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
           shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
           and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

42:003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

42:003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
           of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
           from the wrath to come?

42:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
           not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
           for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
           up children unto Abraham.

42:003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
           tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
           down, and cast into the fire.

42:003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

42:003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let
           him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
           him do likewise.

42:003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
           Master, what shall we do?

42:003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
           appointed you.

42:003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
           shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
           neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

42:003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
           their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

42:003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
           water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
           shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with
           the Holy Ghost and with fire:

42:003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
           floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the
           chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

42:003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
           people.

42:003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
           brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
           done,

42:003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

42:003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
           Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

42:003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
           upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
           my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

42:003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
           (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of
           Heli,

           was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
           God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
           their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
           his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name

           hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
           years:

01:005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

01:005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and

           ground which the LORD hath cursed.
