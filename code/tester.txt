01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
           they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
           there.

01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
           had they for morter.

01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
           lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
           the children of men builded.

01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
           they may not understand one another's speech.

01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
           all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
           did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
           earth.

01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
           and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
           Haran.

01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
           nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
           to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
           dwelt there.

01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
           Terah died in Haran.
37:001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
           the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
           Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
           governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
           priest, saying,

37:001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
           time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
           built.

37:001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

37:001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
           this house lie waste?

37:001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
           ways.

37:001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
           not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
           clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
           earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

37:001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

37:001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
           and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
           the LORD.

37:001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
           brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
           hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
           man unto his own house.

37:001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
           earth is stayed from her fruit.

37:001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
           mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
           the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
           upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
           hands.

37:001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
           Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
           obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
           Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
           the people did fear before the LORD.

37:001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
           unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

37:001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
           of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
           remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
           of the LORD of hosts, their God,

37:001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
           second year of Darius the king.
24:040:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
           Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from
           Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all
           that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which
           were carried away captive unto Babylon.

24:040:002 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
           The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

24:040:003 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath
           said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
           obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

24:040:004 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
           were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with
           me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if
           it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear:
           behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good
           and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

24:040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
           Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
           of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and
           dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
           convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave
           him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

24:040:006 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
           and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the
           land.

24:040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the
           fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of
           Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the
           land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children,
           and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried
           away captive to Babylon;

24:040:008 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
           Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and
           Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
           Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and
           their men.

24:040:009 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
           them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the
           Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,
           and it shall be well with you.

24:040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
           Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine,
           and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and
           dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

24:040:011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
           Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries,
           heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
           and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
           son of Shaphan;

24:040:012 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
           driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto
           Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

24:040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
           the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to
           Mizpah,

24:040:014 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
           king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
           to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them
           not.

24:040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
           secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay
           Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it:
           wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are
           gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
           Judah perish?

24:040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
           Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest
           falsely of Ishmael.
14:034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

14:034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
           walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
           to the right hand, nor to the left.

14:034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
           he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
           twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
           high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
           molten images.

14:034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
           the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
           groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
           in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
           graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

14:034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
           cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
           Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

14:034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
           beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
           idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
           Jerusalem.

14:034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
           the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
           and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
           Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

14:034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
           the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
           Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
           Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
           all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

14:034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
           oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
           workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
           amend the house:

14:034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
           stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
           the kings of Judah had destroyed.

14:034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
           were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
           and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
           set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
           of instruments of musick.

14:034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
           of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
           the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

14:034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
           house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
           of the LORD given by Moses.

14:034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
           found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
           Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

14:034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
           word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
           servants, they do it.

14:034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
           the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
           the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

14:034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
           priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
           king.

14:034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
           law, that he rent his clothes.

14:034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
           and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
           a servant of the king's, saying,

14:034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
           Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
           found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
           upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
           LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

14:034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
           Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
           the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
           Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
           effect.

14:034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
           ye the man that sent you to me,

14:034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
           place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
           that are written in the book which they have read before the
           king of Judah:

14:034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
           works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
           upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

14:034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
           LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

14:034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
           before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
           and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
           before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
           have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

14:034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
           gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
           all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
           inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

14:034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
           Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
           men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
           priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
           and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
           covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

14:034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
           the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
           commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
           his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
           covenant which are written in this book.

14:034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
           to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
           to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

14:034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
           countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
           all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
           LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
           following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
