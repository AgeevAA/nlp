01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
           they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
           there.

01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
           had they for morter.

01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
           lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
           the children of men builded.

01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
           they may not understand one another's speech.

01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
           all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
           did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
           earth.

01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
           and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
           Haran.

01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
           nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
           to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
           dwelt there.

01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
           Terah died in Haran.
